# Security & Authentication Plan

This section defines how user authentication and data security will be implemented, focusing on Google account login for simplicity and strong security.

- Require users to sign in with their Google account to access the Client Dashboard and purchase history.
- Store minimal user information:
  - `id` (UUID)
  - `name`
  - `email`
  - `profile_image` (from Google)
  - `created_at`, `updated_at`

---

## **2. Session Management**
- Use **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure session handling.
- Configure session expiration and automatic refresh tokens for seamless user experience.

---

## **3. Database Security**
- Link Google account email to the `Users` table for identifying orders and downloads.
- Restrict access to only authenticated users for dashboard-related API endpoints.
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

---

## **4. Data Protection**
- All communication will be encrypted using **HTTPS/SSL**.
- Use secure cookies for session tokens (HTTP-only, SameSite, Secure flags).
- No passwords will be stored since authentication is handled by Google OAuth.

---

## **5. Payment & Order Security**
- Pair Google login with **Stripe Checkout** for verified transactions.
- Ensure each order is tied to a unique `user_id` from Google authentication.
- Generate license PDFs only after verified payment.

---

## **6. Future Considerations**
- Option to add other OAuth providers (Apple ID, GitHub) in Phase 3.
- MFA (multi-factor authentication) via Google account security for advanced users.
- Role-based access control (admin vs. client) integrated with Google login.

# Coding Best Practices Plan

This section ensures that the development of the beat-selling and audio service platform follows industry best practices for clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

---

## **1. Project Structure**
- Use a clear, modular folder structure:  
  ```
  /components    # Reusable UI components
  /pages         # Next.js pages
  /styles        # Tailwind CSS and global styles
  /lib           # Utility functions, API clients
  /public        # Static assets
  /api           # API routes (if applicable)
  ```
- Maintain separate configuration files for environment variables, constants, and settings.

---

## **2. Code Quality & Standards**
- Use ESLint and Prettier for consistent formatting and code style.
- Adopt TypeScript for type safety and reduced runtime errors.
- Follow the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle by creating reusable components (e.g., buttons, cards, modals).
- Use descriptive variable and function names.

---

## **3. Version Control & Git**
- Use feature branches with clear naming (e.g., `feature/beat-store`, `fix/cart-bug`).
- Write meaningful commit messages (e.g., "Add waveform preview to Beat Store").
- Use pull requests and code reviews for quality checks.

---

## **4. Component Design**
- Implement atomic design principles where components are built from smaller units:
  - **Atoms:** Buttons, icons, input fields.
  - **Molecules:** Card components, form groups.
  - **Organisms:** Beat store grid, navigation bar.
- Ensure components are responsive and tested for accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation).

---

## **5. Performance Optimization**
- Use Next.js Image component for optimized image loading.
- Implement lazy-loading for audio previews, blog posts, and portfolio items.
- Minimize bundle size with tree-shaking and code splitting.

**Goal:**  
By completing these steps, the MVP will have a functional Home Page, Beat Store, Checkout flow, and Contact form—allowing you to start onboarding clients while continuing to expand features.

# Minimal Styles & Layout Plan

This plan outlines a minimal yet functional foundation for the website’s structure and components. It will be easy to enhance later with more detailed styles and UX patterns.

---

## **1. Core Layout Structure**
- **Global Layout Component (`/components/Layout.tsx`):**
  - Wraps all pages with a consistent Header and Footer.
  - Uses a `<main>` container with responsive padding and max-width settings.
  - Handles page-level `<head>` tags (title, meta).

- **Header Component (`/components/Header.tsx`):**
  - Includes logo (linking to Home).
  - Navigation links: Home, Beat Store, Services, Portfolio, Blog, Contact.
  - Cart icon and Login button (Google OAuth placeholder).
  - Responsive design:
    - Desktop: horizontal navigation with logo on the left and cart/login on the right.
    - Mobile: hamburger menu (Headless UI `Disclosure`).

- **Footer Component (`/components/Footer.tsx`):**
  - Quick links to key pages.
  - Social media icons.
  - Newsletter signup placeholder.
  - Copyright and legal links.

---

## **2. Starter Components**
- **Button Component (`/components/Button.tsx`):**
  - Minimal styles with Tailwind utility classes (e.g., `bg-amber-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded`).
  - Variants: Primary (CTA) and Secondary.

- **Card Component (`/components/Card.tsx`):**
  - Used for beats, blog posts, or portfolio items.
  - Placeholder image area, title, and CTA button.
  - Responsive grid support.

- **AudioPlayer Component (`/components/AudioPlayer.tsx`):**
  - Minimal Wavesurfer.js integration for beat previews.
  - Play/pause button and waveform bar.
  - Sticky at bottom of the page (global playback).

---

## **3. Page Containers**
- **Home Page (`/pages/index.tsx`):**
  - Hero section with placeholder text and CTA buttons.
  - Featured beats grid using `<Card />` components.
  - Contact CTA banner.

- **Beat Store (`/pages/beats.tsx`):**
  - Simple grid layout for beat cards.
  - Minimal filtering bar (static placeholder for now).
  - Add to cart button triggers a simple React state cart.

- **Contact (`/pages/contact.tsx`):**
  - Minimal contact form (name, email, message).
  - Placeholder API route for submissions.

---

## **4. Tailwind Setup**
- Configure Tailwind in `tailwind.config.js` with brand colors:
  ```js
  colors: {
    navy: '#14213D',
    amber: '#FCA311',
    grayLight: '#E5E5E5',
    white: '#FFFFFF',
    green: '#566E3D',
  }
  ```
- Add global styles in `globals.css` with a base font (e.g., Inter).

---

## **5. UX Considerations**
- Keep buttons and interactive elements large enough for mobile users.
- Use Tailwind’s `hover:` and `focus:` states for minimal interactivity.
- Plan for progressive enhancement (animations, advanced UX) later.

---

## **6. Future Enhancements**
- Replace placeholder styles with your custom design system once examples are provided.
- Add Framer Motion animations for page transitions and hover effects.
- Enhance Beat Store filters with live search and tag-based filtering.
