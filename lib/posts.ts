      <p>Getting vocals to sit perfectly in a mix is both an art and a science. Here are five common mistakes that can ruin an otherwise great vocal track:</p>
      <h3>1. Over-compressing</h3>
      <p>While compression is essential for taming dynamics, too much of it can squash the life out of a performance. Use multiple stages of light compression instead of one heavy-handed compressor.</p>
      <h3>2. Not Using De-essing</h3>
      <p>Sibilance (the harsh 's' and 't' sounds) can be incredibly distracting. A de-esser is a specific tool designed to target these frequencies without affecting the overall vocal tone.</p>
      <h3>3. Ignoring EQ</h3>
      <p>Every voice is different. Use a surgical EQ to cut out muddy low-mid frequencies (around 200-500Hz) and add a touch of "air" with a high-shelf boost above 10kHz.</p>
